EPS of $1.86 outperformed JPMe/Street estimates of $1.76 and $1.71, respectively. We expect shares to trade substantially higher based upon the 1Q18 EPS beat and mgmt commentary that 2018 earnings will likely be towards the high end of guidance. We note that mgmt’s revised outlook is especially constructive because AXP does not usually update guidance after 1Q earnings. Our Dec-18 PT remains unchanged at $100. This equates to 12.5x our 2019 EPS estimate of $8.00. While we believe AXP will continue to drive strong billings growth, the impact may be dampened if a new rewards race emerges or as recent loan growth manifests into higher credit expenses. We acknowledge that the time horizon for these headwinds to emerge appears more distant that we previously assumed.Strong 1Q18 drives guidance higher.Mgmt now expects Y/Y revenue growth of at least 8% (vs. 7% -8% previously) and expects 2018 EPS towards the high end of the previously identified $6.90 -$7.30 range. Increased consumer confidence drove billings growth and loan growth across nearly all customer and geographic segments.Expenses climb 9% Y/Y, expected to climb higher in FY18.Higher co-brand agreement spending, as well as rewards and cardmember services expenses, were the key drivers for 1Q18 opex. Mgmt expects 1Q18 to be the low point for expenses. Mgmt anticipates higher spending on cardmember services, and expects that the segment will be the fastest growing expense on a percentage basis for the year. Increased media and marketing costs related to a new global brand campaign launched this month are also expected to drive higher expenses through the rest of the year.Rising interest ratesa “modest, but growing”challenge in 2018.Mgmt reviewed AXP’s funding strategy, given the company’s rate-sensitivity. Deposits remain AXP’s cheapest cost of funds and totaled $67B in 1Q18. $32B of that amount is in sweep accounts and CDs and $35B in online personal savings accounts. Mgmt notes that AXP’s historical deposit beta since mid-2016 has been ~0.45x, but that has been trending higher towards 0.6x. Mgmt assumes a deposit beta of 0.7x for internal planning purposes.Other funding sources are ABS and corporate debt. Mgmt also notes that the unexpected spread compression between the prime rate and funding costs (based on LIBOR) is pressuring net interest yields more than expected.Completed     18 Apr 2018 10:35 PM EDTDisseminated 19 Apr 2018 12:15 AM EDT"

ABChas a leading position in oncology, reaching more than half of all community-based oncologists in the U.S., and is also a leading distributor in the dialysis, blood plasma product and vaccine markets.  Recall that we hosted a conference call on Monday afternoon with CEO Steve Collis and CFO Tim Guttman.  See our note herefor key takeaways from the call.Specialty should continue to provide a solid growth opportunity.  According to data from IQVIA, specialty drug sales were$196Bin 2017 on an invoice price basis, up ~9% y/y, and compared to ~1% y/y growth for the overallpharmamarket. Specialty drugs accounted for ~43% of total pharma sales in 2017, up from 35% in 2014, with industry sources projecting it to reach 55% in 2021, driven by a robust pipeline of specialty drugs and strong sales ramps for newly launched productsABC is the largest specialty pharmaceutical distributor based on revenue.  AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG) revenues were$31.5B in FY17, or ~19% of total revenuebefore intrasegment eliminations, and up ~10% y/y.  While ABCdoes not provide disclosure on ABSG margins, the company has indicated in the past that specialty margins are abovecore drug distribution.  Weestimate ABSG accounted for ~23% of total adjusted operating profit.  We expect continued strong growth for the legacy ABSG businesses going forward. As of the end of FY17, ABSG had delivered 15 consecutive quarters of growth in excess of 10%.  While ABCwill no longer break out disclosure on ABSGgoing forward due toareorganization of the operating structure effective 9/30/17, we would expect revenue to continue to grow in the double digit rate going forward. Margin expansion opportunity fromspecialty generics and biosimilars.In the past, ABC had seen strong contribution from certain specialty generic launches, although we have seen fewer material launches more recently.  Biosimilars represent a potentialprofit driver, dependingon whether products fall under the medical benefit or whether discounting is done up front or via rebates on the back end.Potential reimbursement changesfor Part B drugs could drive a headwind for specialty distributors.While not directly reimbursed under Part B, distributors could see a volume/margin headwind if lower reimbursement causes physicians to shift patients to the hospital setting or sell their practices to hospital groups.Completed     05 Apr 2018 01:46 AM EDTDisseminated 05 Apr 2018 02:14 AM EDT"

Driven by acquisitions, ABC has delivered strong growth in the Other segment (comprised of MWI, World Courier and ABCS), and while we project this segment tocomprise just under4% of the company’s total F2018E revenue, we estimate it will account for ~18% of adjusted operating profit. Recall that we hosted a conference call on Monday afternoon with CEO Steve Collis and CFO Tim Guttman.  See our note herefor key takeaways from the call.We are lowering estimates to reflect adelay in the resumption ofproduction at PharMEDium’s Memphis facility.  Following the 8-K on 4/2, we are lowering our FY18 adjusted EPS estimate by $0.16, and now assume production at the Memphis facility resumes inearly F4Q (vs. ABC's prior F2Q expectation).  Note that given the level of automation, the Memphis facility contributesa large portion of profitability. We are lowering our FY19 estimate by $0.12as we assume it takes time toreach full productionand that not all lost volume is immediately recaptured.ABC believes PharMEDium issues are manageable and remains positive on the longer term outlook.  PharMEDium is the leading national provider of customized outsourced compounded sterile preparations (CSPs) to acute care hospitals in the U.S. There are no other pure play national competitors, and ABChas noted that PharMEDium is 3x larger than its closest competitor. The company believes the fundamental outlook remains intact, driven by strong demand for outsourced CSPs.We estimate MWI drives roughly half of ABC’s Other segment revenue.  A leading animal health distributor, MWI serves the companion and production animal markets.  MWI reported nearly $3B in revenues in FY14. Animal health distribution in the U.S. has consolidated around three large players (MWI, Patterson and Henry Schein).MWI provided revenue diversification, and is expected to drive cost and purchasing synergies (at least $50M in synergies by year three).World Courier specializes in logistics for global clinical trials.  The WCG acquisition strengthened ABC’s service offerings to global pharmaceutical manufacturers, and provided an established platform from which to grow its service offering outside of North America given WCG’s large global network (the company operates in 50+ countries worldwideand has an established distribution network).

On day 1 of Anadarko Week, we set the table with our investment thesis and10 factors why we believe APC is poised to outperform the peer groupin 2018. Despite the improvement in near-term fundamentals in the oil market, the back-end of the oil curve remains stubbornlyrange bound in the $55 to $60 per bbl range. Against this backdrop, the idea of FCF generation and disciplined capital allocation is becoming increasingly important as investors look for names that can deliver value through the cycle. In our view, APC is well positioned for this shift in investor attitude toward the sector given its long-term capital allocationphilosophy of investing within organic cash flow and improved margin profile following successful portfolio management. Ahead of this shift in investor sentiment, APC began an active portfolio management process in 2015, which included the jettisoning of $7.0 billion of lower margin naturalgas weighted assets and contrarian purchase of $2.0 billion of deepwater GoM assets from a motivated seller at less than 2.0x cash flow. These strategic moves along with the company’s franchise assets in the DJ and Delaware Basins have positioned APC to deliver double digit oil growth through at least 2020, while returning significant cash to investors, which we see as the recipe for successfor large cap diversifieds. We raise our 12-month target price to $72from $70 to incorporate our updated estimates at the strip, whichimplies 5.6xour 2019E EBITDA and parity with our revised NAV.Factor 1—Returningsignificantcash back to shareholders, while delivering value added oil growth.Since 2017, a common characteristic of upstream winners have been companies that have successfully transitioned to FCF stories or executed balanced capital allocation programs.We continue to believe this theme has legs and could continue to differentiate the stocks, particularly the large caps. Based on our updated modeling at the strip, we see potential for APC to return more than $6.5billion to shareholders between 4Q17 and the end of 2020 inclusive of the $1.00/annum dividend. We believe APC could announce a further increase in its buyback authorization that currently stands at $3.0 billion in 2H18 if solid oil price fundamentals hold.                                                1On January 3, 2018, MIFID II came into effect.

Despite its advantaged acreage position that is concentrated in the deepest, thickest, and over-pressured portion of the basin, APC's historical performance hasbeen malignedgiven below-average well productivity. Our own analysis confirms that APC's 2017 well performance was in the bottom quartile relative to the peer group. We believe the company's historical results have been hindered by limited infrastructure as well as the company’s operatorship capture activities that have come to a close. The key finding in our work is our expectation that pastdrilling results are not indicative of the future. We analyzed optimized wells in close proximity to infrastructure and these wells are not only significantly outperforming historical results, but also the company’s 1.6 MMBoe type curve. In 2H18, we expect a strong growth inflection in the Delaware given the anticipated completion of significant infrastructure projects in Reeves and north Loving and the full adoption of Gen 2.0 completions in the basin. Based on our bottoms up modeling, we are forecasting 66%, 47%, and 31% oil growth from the Delaware between 2018 and 2020, which is a key driver supporting the company’s double digit oil growth objective through 2020. From a bigger picture standpoint, the Delaware not only anchors the corporate-wide oil growth objectives, but also provides important growth projectsfor Western Gas to sustain strongfuture distribution growth at the MLP. Judging by recent A&D activity and our analysis, we think acreage in the northern Delaware Basin core is among the most valuable in all of U.S.E&P.We reiterate our OW rating and Dec-18 price target of $72 per share.Delaware Basin is core “franchise asset"" for APC:One of the most important characteristics of a successful E&P company is the ownership of core franchise assets that provide an inventory of low-cost and low-risk development drilling opportunities. APCholds interests in 589,000 gross (240,000 net) acres in the Delaware Basin with a large portion of the acreage concentrated in prolific Loving, Reeves, and Ward Counties (see Figure 3). The company’s acreage position includes multiple stacked pays across a hydrocarbon column that is up to 8,500 ft.thick from the shallower Avalon horizons to the Bone Spring and deeper Wolfcamp objectives. APC estimates 5,500 undrilledWolfcamp A (WC A) wells and 4,500 wells from other stacked pay objectivesacross its acreage. We see 58% wellhead IRRs for optimized WC A wells at the current strip.

Despite world-class resources and stacked pay potential at Wattenberg, the DJ Basin has generally played second fiddle to other U.S. resource plays such as the Permian given midstream and above the ground regulatory challenges as well as concerns on oil mixthat have plagued the basin over the past few years. In 2016 and 2017, DJ Basin focused producers underperformed the XOP Index by 13% and 10%, respectively. Despite the maturity of this play, our analysis confirms meaningful well productivity gains from APC’senhancedcompletion design that was tested in 2017 on the bulk of the company’s short and mid-lateral length wells. For select advantaged producers such as APC, we believe the value creation potential from this play is often overlooked. One of the key surprises from our analysis was the magnitude of FCF generation in the 2018 to 2021period given the high level of production growth. This combination (high production growth and FCF generation) has proven elusive for U.S. shale producers and reflects APC’s unique combination of quality rocks in the core, midstream integration, and minerals ownership. While regulatory concerns could be heightened given the looming election cycle, we continue to see an attractive risk-reward in APC shares. We reiterate our OW rating and $72 per share price target.DJ Basin is core “franchise asset"" for APC: One of the most important characteristics of a successful E&P company is the ownership of core franchise assets that provide an inventory of low-cost and low-risk development drilling opportunities. APC holds interests in 335K acres in the DJ Basin. APC estimates 4,000 undrilled locations in the DJ Basin, including 3,100 locations in the contiguous core. Based on the company’s new completion design, we see 89% wellhead IRRs for the company’s acreage in the core.Elusive combination of high oil growth and FCF generation supports cash return strategy: One of the key findings in our analysis is the magnitude of growth and FCF generation the company should be able to generate from its DJ Basin franchise asset.In 2018, we forecast $1.6 billion in FCF, rising to $1.8 billion in 2019 and 2020 at the strip. In 2021, we expect APC's DJ Basin asset to contribute more than $2.0 billion in asset level FCF. The strong FCF generation profile is especially impressive given our expectation of 18% per annum oil growth from 2018 through 2020.We see 10% oil growth in 2021.Completed     18 Apr 2018 12:17 AM EDTDisseminated 18 Apr 2018 01:08 AM EDT"

We also review the company's balance sheet strength. In the go-go days of shale, the principal valuation tool was net asset value (NAV). Under a pure NAV approach conventional assets received limited airplay as they generally provided only limited valuation upside outsideof changes in commodity prices. The market generally valued these assets at PDP valuethat declinedover time. While we think NAV remains a useful valuation tool for evaluating the space, one of the consistent themes that we have articulated throughout Anadarko Week is the growing importance of FCF generation. In an environment where cash return to shareholders is a critical driver of E&P stock performance, conventional assets with attractive FCF characteristics have more strategic importance, we think. Our modeling confirms that APC’s conventional assets (GoM, Ghana, and Algeria) that are levered to attractive Brent/LLS pricing are key drivers of the company’s FCF generation potential, which should enable meaningful cash return to shareholders. Based on our updated modeling at the strip,we see more than $6.5 billion in cash return to shareholders between 4Q17 and the end of 2020 inclusive of the dividend. Importantly, we anticipate a relatively flat production profile from the company's key conventional assets with growth from the TEN field in Ghana offsetting natural field declines in Algeria, while GoM volumes should be relatively flat given the company's tieback inventory and participation in the Hadrian North discovery. We reiterate our OW rating and $72 per share price target.Attractive portfolio of conventional assets should support strong FCF.We believe APC’s reshaped asset base through active portfolio management has an optimal mix of stable conventional production (low sustainingcapex and high margins) to deliver attractive debt adjusted growth and significant free cash flow. In the GoM, we are modeling more than $1.0 billion in FCF per annum through 2020and an average of $650 MM per annum in FCF from Algeria and Ghana. Importantly, APC's overall oil production from the GoM, Ghana and Algeria should be relatively flat over this time period at ~210MBo/d.Completed     20 Apr 2018 01:21 AM EDTDisseminated 20 Apr 2018 01:55 AM EDT"

Investors should consider this report as only a single factor in making their investment decision.EPS Results.Operating EPS $0.09v. JPMe $0.10and consensus $0.06.Our Take.As we expect to be a theme for large cap service prints, we think Baker Hughes’ 1Q18 results are fairly innocuous for the stock following a walk-down of Street expectationsearlier in thequarter. The quarter matched JPMe on revenue and EBITDA with the operating beat driven by lower D&A. The company highlighted some nice contract/share wins (e.g. wireline and drilling in GOM, subsea/EPCI, chems, lift) that should offer fodder for BHGE's conference call (and others’). FCF in 1Q should be welcomed by shareholders, though capex was extremely light and WC still a use of cash (not a surprise for 1Q); we think FCF trajectory remains critical to show solid dividend coverage. With a lower bar than peers to bridge the gap to 2Q (+13% q/q to Street EBITDA), the stock is well positioned to outperform modestly barring any surprises on the call, particularly around TPS expectations. TPS remains a blind spot for most investors in our view, and expectations vary widely as a result. They want the coming LNG cycle (and impact to BHGE) better framed out. Operating Details.BakerHughes’ operating EPS of $0.09and adjusted EBITDA of $616mm (-13% q/q) effectivelymatched our numbers on in-line revenue (-7% q/q, -1% v. JPMe) and margin (-80bps q/q, +5bps v. JPMe) aided by lower D&A (worth ~3% to EBITDA). Results exclude $269mm ($0.08/sh) of charges mostly related to $162mm of restructuring and $61mm of inventory write-down. Segment margin results were mostly consistent with expectations, with OFS margin posting slightly better (+135bps v. JPMe, +160bps q/q) and Digital modestly worse (-105bps v. JPMe, -425bps q/q). Total orders of $5.2bn declined 8% q/q (+2% v. JPMe, 0.97x book:bill), while FCF came in better attributable roughly evenly to lower capex and cash restructuring.  Segment Results.Turbomachinery:EBIT of $119mm(36% mix) mostly matched our estimate despite a revenue shortfall (-12% q/q, -6% v. JPMe) as margin came in ~60bps higher relative to JPMe. Orders of $1.45bn (0.99x book:bill) declined 16% q/q as strength in equipment new units was offset by lower contractual services volume. Oilfield Services:EBIT of $141mmbested our estimate (+38% q/q, +37% v. JPMe) on modestly higher revenue (+3% v. JPMe) as improved product mix, synergies and lower D&A drove margins higher (+133bps v. JPMe). NAM revenue was flat q/q while international decreased 6%. Oilfield Equipment:EBIT of -$6mm remained in negative territory on flattish revenue (+2% q/q, +8% v. JPMe) and a 36bp decremental. Orders of $499mm (0.75x book:bill) came in ~3% lower q/q, but in line with JPMe, as equipment dropped 5% y/y while services gained 18%. Digital Solutions:EBIT of $73mm fell 38% q/q (-14% v. JPMe) on weaker top line (-17% q/q, -7% v. JPMe) and margin compression (~425bps q/q) due to seasonality. Orders declined 6% q/q (1.09x book:bill, -4% v. JPMe).Completed     20 Apr 2018 08:49 AM EDTDisseminated 20 Apr 2018 08:58 AM EDT"

Retail sales based on Cielo were up 2.2% yoy in real terms during Marchthe highest value of the year, increasing since mid-2017, while data from IBGE related to February posted a 1.2% yoy increase in nominal terms. Another positive highlight was the level of credit concession to individuals (+43%yoy in February) and consumers’credit demand (+8% yoy in March).Moreover, traffic data, consumer confidence and the unemployment rate continue to improve on a yearly basis, which in our view should be drivers for the recovery in companies’ SSS. Despite the positive trend on retail data, the sector is underperforming the Ibovespa by 19pp YTD, which in our view is a consequence of investors’ concern regarding SSS recovery and margin improvement. We remain optimistic on the malls segment, as we expect the recent improvements in consumption indexes and the reduction in interest rates to reflect on companies results over the following quarters.We continue to preferBRML and ALSC. Among our Neutral rated names, we favor IGTA over MULT.Please refer to Page 2 for all the metrics analyzed. Retail figures continue to show a positive trend.The positive trend is noticed in the 3 main retail indexes. Figures from Cielowereat the highest level of the year, andthe highest level since 2014 when excluding Nov-17up 2.2% yoy in real terms andcalendar adjusted.

Figures from IBGE, which havea one month lag, were up 1.2% yoy in nominal terms, with the Apparel segment underperformingat -5.7% yoy in the period, reverting the strong performance seen since 2H17.Improvement in credit fundamentals could translate into consumption.Credit demand data from Serasa posted a strong 7.7% yoy increase in March, accumulating close to +12% YTD. As noted in past months, all income segments showed a positive performance, with families earning up to R$500 monthly posting the highest increase at 23% yoy.Credit concession to individuals showed a 43% yoy expansion,according to Central Bank data, up from a weak base in Feb-17, which was the weakest month of 2017.Clients' flow at malls details.IVSC index from Abrasce (Malls association) posted a 2.5% yoy increase in March, also supportingthepositive trend observed in the past 12 months. In addition, data from IBOPE posted a 1.0% yoy acceleration ofvisitors at malls.Malls’recent underperformancenot justified by midtermfundamentals.The five companies under our coverage are underperforming the Ibovespa by 19pp YTD, down 10% in the period. BRML is the worst performer, down 12% YTD, while ALSC is the top performer (-6% in the period). In our view, the recent weak performance is likely explained by the slight deceleration in operational results during 4Q17 results and potential concerns regarding 1Q18 numbers. However, we recall that despite the expected aggregated increase of 2% on the top line for 2018, we foresee FFO expansion of 22% for thesector this year, due to lower financial results.Table 1: BZ Malls ValuationSummaryRatingPT (R$)P/FFO 19eBRMLOW14.0014.9xALSC OW23.0013.2xSSBROW28.0011.6xIGTAN44.0015.4xMULTN78.0016.7xAvg.15.3xSource: J.P.

Our base case does not yet contemplate such changes, thus we could see upside for them if they are approved. Our favorite name remains TIMon a positive outlook for Brazil mobilecoupled with impressive company performance.Regulatory changes not needed but highly desirable for consolidation. Under the current rules, one existing operator would need to return the spectrum of an acquired operator. Moreover, concessionswill expire in 2025,with no clarity on what would happen afterward.Anatel started a process to increase spectrum limits (caps). Under current regulation, each frequency band (700, 800, 1800, 2500 MHz, etc.), has its own limits. That could change soon to only two restrictions (sub and above 1 GHz) as it is already under the current public consultation.The long-awaited PL79 would be a major overhaul of the telco regulation. . .especially for fixed-line concessions (Oi and to a lesserextent Vivo) as it would change that to renewable authorizations and would free capital from useless quality requirements into more desirable broadband. . . . However, it is unlikely to be approved this year given the short window until Senators focus onthe coming elections.Also, any change in the project would require another vote by the Lower Chamber. And it could be a mixed blessing for current operators as it would also facilitate the entry of a foreign player in Brazil. We have highlighted the risk of Oi being acquired by China Telecom and subsequently increasing investments and making the market more competitive. PGMUmay help concessions, but that also does not seem likely in the shortterm. The delay in the PL79 approval may hinder the PGMU(wireline voice universalization goals), which could reduce the quality requirements of concessions as Anatel cannot efficiently allocate the extra capital (for instance, into broadband). The TAC was not a good indication for the companies as Vivo failed to exchange fines for more investmentsfollowing tough negotiations with Anatel and TCU. That could signal further difficulties on the additional investments once the PL79 is approved. Bottom line: positive view on Brazil mobile (Tim toppick), butnot driven by reforms. We seea benign environment in mobile, partially driven by Oi underinvestment, which is helping the margins of other operators. If these reforms are approved, we could see additional upside for the companies coming from M&A synergies or cost savings.Table 1: Valuation 2018ETickerEV/EBFCF Y%AMX N6.16.3%ENTELUW7.20.6%MEGACPOOW8.33.7%MIC SSUW5.9NATEO N6.7-1.5%TIMP3OW5.83.3%VIVT4N5.34.8%Median6.13.7%Source: J.P.
